Data Acquisition

The Learning Wizard can handle two different sources for acquiring
data for the learning:

        Plain text files
        (Databases)

Plain Text Files

The plain text files must conform to a certain standard:

        - Each line in the file must consist of a list of values
        - The values must be separated by a separator, with the
          default separator being ",".
	- All lines must contain the same number of values
        - The following symbols are accepted as missing
          values: "N/A", "null", "<null>"

A sample data file could be:

field1,field2,field3
true,true,false
N/A,true,true
false,false,true
false,true,false
false,N/A,false

Using this datafile will result in a model with three nodes named:
field1, field2, and field3. Each node will contain the states: true,
false.

Text File Specification

The specification of the text file is entered using the fields in the
text file pane:


The data file can either be typed manually in the text field, or the
"Browse" button can be used to locate the data file.

If the datafile does not contain the names of the fields, the "Read
node names from file" checkbox should be unchecked. This will cause
the Learning Wizard to treat the first line of the file in the same
way as any other line. Furthermore, the nodes will get generic names
(i.e., Field_n, where n = 0,..,m).

If the fields in the text file is not separated by one of the standard
separators (or if one or more of the standard separators are used in
the field values), the user should specify a separator:



This may actually be a set of separators (each character typed in the
separator specification field will be treated as a separator), but
this is not recommended.
