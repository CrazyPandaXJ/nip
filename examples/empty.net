% Simple DBN model (an HMM actually): 
% A man lives in his house, sleeping or being awake (variable A1),
% and keeps his lights on (variable L1) usually only when awake.
% Daily (secret) activities are governed by transitions 
% (state of A1, given A0) and reflected in the (observed) lights.
% Parameters left out.
